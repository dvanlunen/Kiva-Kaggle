# Kiva-Kaggle

Kiva provides financial services to poor and financially excluded people around the world. In order to best fulfill their mission, they need to evaluate potential borrowers' poverty levels and inform lenders.

A key issue involved in this process is localization. Most information about borrowers is at a high, generalized level. However, it would be most useful for Kiva to have information at a much more granular level.

The notebook in this repo begins to explore the provided Kiva datasets.
